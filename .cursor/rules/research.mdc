## Prerequisites

- [Perplexity API key](https://www.perplexity.ai/settings/api)
- Perplexity and Playwright MCP Tools: The user should put the following in `File > Cursor Settings > MCP > Add new global MCP server`, replacing `your_perplexity_api_key` with the actual Perplexity API key:
   ```json
   {
      "mcpServers": {
         "perplexity-mcp": {
            "env": {
            "PERPLEXITY_API_KEY": "your_perplexity_api_key",
            "PERPLEXITY_MODEL": "sonar"
            },
            "command": "uvx",
            "args": [
            "mcp-perplexity"
            ]
         },
         "playwright": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["-y", "@executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server"]
         }
      }
   }
   ```

If these tools are not available to you, guide the user through setup.

## Deep Internet Research

For deep Internet research and question-answering, send queries to a Perplexity research agent using the `mcp-perplexity` tool.

If the Perplexity tool is not available and the user does not want to install it, you can use your built-in web search tool.

## Direct Website Retrieval

Perplexity and web search are not appropriate for direct website retrieval. For this, you should use `playwright` tool. If that is not available and the user does not want to install it, you may be able to use `wget`.
