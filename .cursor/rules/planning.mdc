## Initial Assessment Phase

Before beginning work, the agent should:

1. **Understand the High-Level Goals**:
   - What are we trying to accomplish?
   - What are the project deliverables?
   - How will we define and validate success?

2. **Understand the Constraints**:
   - Does the user have a preferred tech stack?
   - What is the ultimate deployment target?
   - Where should we place deliverables, as opposed to intermediate working files (which go in `artifacts/`)?

3. **Formulate High-Level Strategy**:
   - Identify broadly what high-level steps need to be taken, and in what order, and list the steps in `artifacts/project_plan.md`
   - Address any potential failure points or bottlenecks by front-loading implementation research or feasibility assessment tasks
   - In each step, mention available specific rule sets to consult when completing that step (e.g., "Review the rule for scraping and extracting data from simple static websites with Bash and `wget`")
